###Locals
Some of our local friends have graciously offered spots in their apartments so if you are interested in staying in one of those let me know asap.  I'm sure they'll fill up fast. 

### Hotels
The [Courtyard Marriott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sfocd-courtyard-san-francisco-downtown/) is 50ft from the Barrel House doors.  

### Airbnb
This is the way to do it. We've looked up a bunch in locations either near the Barrel House in SOMA or near our loft in Dogpatch that range from 2 people to 10 people.  The more people the cheaper it is, plus you can get a bigger space.
