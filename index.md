##Bess and I turn 30 this Spring and we're going big. 

So many questions, is there going to be a theme? what do I wear?  Slow down... We haven't figured that stuff out yet, but we will and it will be awesome, you know us. We've been locking down more important stuff like the hashtag. Ok a little more than that.

This is what we have nailed down: 

##The Party
####Sat @ the Barrel House SF
Yep, we locked down the same venue we had the incredible party from our wedding. 

####DJ // Sibling Rivalryâ„¢ 
What!! They were available?  Hell yeah and we booked them.  The Blackstock brother/sister DJ duo will be spinning jams all night.  Unlike the wedding where the band had to stop, Sibling Rivalry doesn't stop. 

####Food Truck // Open Bar // Midnight Pizza
I mean people love food trucks and we're going to have one. 
Yep open bar, everything. I'm going to go nuts at Costco that week. 
Yeah I'll probably order a bunch of Pizza's at midnight because after dancing and drinking EVERYONE WANTS PIZZA.


##Rest of the Time
####Cocktails Friday @ the Friday's
Friday night we'll open up our Loft for everyone to come hang out and catch up. 

####Wed-Fri
We'll be taking work off the week leading up to the big event so anyone that wants to come in early we've got some day trips planned to wine country and some of our other favorite places in the Bay Area. 


We've also got stuff planned throughout the week leading up to the big event too so if you have vacation time now is the time to take it.
